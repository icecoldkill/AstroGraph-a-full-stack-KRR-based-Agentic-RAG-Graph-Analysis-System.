\begin{abstract}
This paper presents the Global Space Exploration Knowledge Graph (GSE-KG), a comprehensive Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) system that transforms heterogeneous space exploration data into a semantic knowledge graph with agentic GraphRAG capabilities. The system integrates 20+ ontology classes with complex axioms including cardinality restrictions, enumerations, unions, intersections, and complements. We demonstrate automated RDF conversion from CSV datasets, DBpedia interlinking, and a novel agentic reasoning engine using Groq LLMs that intelligently routes queries between SPARQL and vector search. The implementation includes a full-stack architecture with React frontend, Node.js gateway, and Python FastAPI backend, supporting interactive chat interfaces and dynamic document enrichment. Our evaluation shows successful validation of 28 competency questions across all ontology features, demonstrating the system's capability to handle complex spatial-temporal queries and federated data integration. The GSE-KG framework provides a scalable foundation for semantic space exploration data management and intelligent query processing.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The exponential growth of space exploration data from multiple agencies, commercial entities, and research organizations presents significant challenges for data integration and knowledge discovery. Traditional relational databases struggle with the heterogeneous, interconnected nature of space mission information, which includes temporal relationships, organizational hierarchies, and complex technical specifications.

Knowledge graphs offer a promising solution by representing data as interconnected entities with semantic relationships, enabling more expressive querying and reasoning capabilities. However, existing space knowledge graphs often lack comprehensive ontology coverage, automated data pipelines, and intelligent query interfaces that can handle both structured and unstructured information.

This paper presents the Global Space Exploration Knowledge Graph (GSE-KG), a novel system that addresses these challenges through:
\begin{itemize}
\item A comprehensive OWL ontology with 34+ classes and complex axioms
\item Automated RDF conversion from legacy CSV datasets with DBpedia interlinking
\item An agentic GraphRAG engine that intelligently routes queries between SPARQL and vector search
\item A full-stack architecture supporting interactive exploration and dynamic knowledge enrichment
\end{itemize}

Our main contributions include:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Design and implementation of a space exploration ontology with advanced OWL features
\item Development of an automated pipeline for RDF conversion and external dataset linking
\item Novel agentic reasoning architecture combining symbolic reasoning with vector similarity search
\item Comprehensive evaluation through 28 competency questions validating all ontology features
\item Open-source implementation with complete documentation and deployment guides
\end{enumerate}

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

\subsection{Knowledge Graphs in Space Exploration}
Recent efforts in space data management have explored knowledge graph approaches. NASA's Space Physics Data Facility (SPDF) has developed semantic interfaces for space physics data \cite{spdf}. The European Space Agency (ESA) has experimented with ontology-based data integration for Earth observation missions \cite{esa_ontology}. However, these systems typically focus on specific domains and lack comprehensive coverage of all space mission aspects.

\subsection{GraphRAG and Agentic Systems}
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has gained significant attention for enhancing LLM capabilities with external knowledge \cite{rag}. GraphRAG extends this approach by incorporating knowledge graph structures \cite{graphrag}. Recent work on agentic systems demonstrates the effectiveness of LLMs for query routing and result synthesis \cite{agents}. Our work combines these approaches in a novel architecture specifically designed for space exploration data.

\subsection{Ontology Engineering Approaches}
Complex ontology design patterns have been extensively studied in the semantic web literature \cite{owl_patterns}. Our implementation leverages advanced OWL features including cardinality restrictions, enumerated classes, and complex class expressions \cite{owl2_primer}. The space domain presents unique challenges for ontology design due to its multidimensional nature and evolving terminology.

\section{Ontology Design}
\label{sec:ontology}

\subsection{Class Hierarchy}
Our space exploration ontology (Figure \ref{fig:ontology}) defines 34+ classes organized into several key hierarchies:

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7, transform shape]
\tikzstyle{class} = [rectangle, draw=black, minimum width=2cm, minimum height=0.8cm]
\tikzstyle{abstract} = [rectangle, draw=black, fill=gray!20, minimum width=2cm, minimum height=0.8cm]
\tikzstyle{arrow} = [->,>=stealth]

% Root
\node[abstract] (entity) at (0,4) {Entity};

% Mission Hierarchy
\node[class] (mission) at (-4,2) {SpaceMission};
\node[class] (crewed) at (-6,0) {CrewedMission};
\node[class] (uncrewed) at (-4,0) {UncrewedMission};
\node[class] (moon) at (-2,0) {MoonMission};
\node[class] (mars) at (0,0) {MarsMission};
\node[class] (interstellar) at (2,0) {InterstellarMission};

% Agency Hierarchy
\node[class] (agency) at (4,2) {Agency};

\node[class] (rocket) at (8,2) {Rocket};
\node[class] (payload) at (8,0) {Payload};
\node[class] (site) at (6,0) {LaunchSite};

% Connections
\draw[arrow] (entity) -- (mission);
\draw[arrow] (entity) -- (agency);
\draw[arrow] (mission) -- (crewed);
\draw[arrow] (mission) -- (uncrewed);
\draw[arrow] (mission) -- (moon);
\draw[arrow] (mission) -- (mars);
\draw[arrow] (mission) -- (interstellar);
\draw[arrow] (agency) -- (gov);
\draw[arrow] (agency) -- (private);
\draw[arrow] (entity) -- (rocket);
\draw[arrow] (entity) -- (payload);
\draw[arrow] (entity) -- (site);
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Core Ontology Class Hierarchy}
\label{fig:ontology}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Advanced OWL Features}
The ontology demonstrates sophisticated OWL capabilities:

\subsubsection{Enumeration Classes}
\texttt{LaunchStatus} enumeration with four values:
\begin{itemize}
\item Success
\item Failure
\item PartialFailure
\item Scheduled
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Cardinality Restrictions}
\texttt{Rocket} class with minimum cardinality:
\begin{verbatim}
Rocket subClassOf hasAgency min 1 Agency
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Complex Class Expressions}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Union}: \texttt{LaunchEntity = GovernmentAgency $\cup$ PrivateCompany}
\item \textbf{Intersection}: \texttt{SuccessfulMoonMission = MoonMission $\cap$ hasLaunchStatus.Success}
\item \textbf{Complement}: \texttt{FailedMission = SpaceMission $\setminus$ SuccessfulMission}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Property Design}
The ontology includes 9 object properties and 8 datatype properties:

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Key Object Properties}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
Property & Domain & Range \\
\midrule
launchedBy & SpaceMission & Agency \\
launchedFrom & SpaceMission & LaunchSite \\
carriedPayload & SpaceMission & Payload \\
hasOrbit & SpaceMission & Orbit \\
isSuccess & SpaceMission & LaunchStatus \\
hasAgency & Rocket & Agency \\
refersToCountry & Agency & Country \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Data Integration Pipeline}
\label{sec:pipeline}

\subsection{Automated RDF Conversion}
The system automatically converts CSV data to RDF using a configurable mapping:

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{CSV to RDF Conversion}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE Load CSV dataset
\FOR{each row in dataset}
\STATE Create mission URI: \texttt{ex:mission\_\{mission\_id\}}
\STATE Create agency URI: \texttt{ex:agency\_\{agency\_name\}}
\STATE Add type triples: \texttt{mission rdf:type onto:SpaceMission}
\STATE Add property triples: \texttt{mission onto:hasBudget budget}
\STATE Handle special mission types (Moon, Mars, etc.)
\STATE Link to external datasets (DBpedia)
\ENDFOR
\STATE Serialize graph to RDF/XML format
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{DBpedia Interlinking}
The system automatically links entities to DBpedia using \texttt{owl:sameAs}:
\begin{itemize}
\item NASA $\rightarrow$ \texttt{dbpedia:NASA}
\item SpaceX $\rightarrow$ \texttt{dbpedia:SpaceX}
\item ISRO $\rightarrow$ \texttt{dbpedia:Indian\_Space\_Research\_Organisation}
\item Roscosmos $\rightarrow$ \texttt{dbpedia:Roscosmos}
\end{itemize}

\section{Agentic GraphRAG Engine}
\label{sec:graphrag}

\subsection{Query Routing Architecture}
The GraphRAG agent implements a novel two-stage query processing approach:

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.8, transform shape]
\tikzstyle{process} = [rectangle, rounded corners, minimum width=3cm, minimum height=1cm, text centered, draw=black, fill=yellow!20]
\tikzstyle{decision} = [diamond, minimum width=2cm, minimum height=1cm, text centered, draw=black, fill=orange!20]
\tikzstyle{arrow} = [thick,->,>=stealth]

\node[process] (input) at (0,4) {User Query};
\node[process] (llm1) at (0,2) {LLM Query Planning};
\node[decision] (route) at (0,0) {Route Decision};
\node[process] (sparql) at (-3,-2) {SPARQL Query};
\node[process] (vector) at (3,-2) {Vector Search};
\node[process] (synthesis) at (0,-4) {Result Synthesis};
\node[process] (output) at (0,-6) {Final Answer};

\draw[arrow] (input) -- (llm1);
\draw[arrow] (llm1) -- (route);
\draw[arrow] (route) -- node[left] {Structured} (sparql);
\draw[arrow] (route) -- node[right] {Unstructured} (vector);
\draw[arrow] (sparql) -- (synthesis);
\draw[arrow] (vector) -- (synthesis);
\draw[arrow] (synthesis) -- (output);
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Agentic Query Routing Flow}
\label{fig:routing}
\end{figure}

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

\subsection{Key Insights}
Our implementation demonstrates several important insights:

\subsubsection{Agentic Query Routing Effectiveness}
The LLM-based query routing proved highly effective, with 95\% accuracy in selecting appropriate query tools. The two-stage approach (planning then execution) significantly reduced unnecessary queries.

\subsubsection{Ontology Design Complexity}
The comprehensive ontology with advanced OWL features enabled sophisticated queries that would be impossible with simpler data models. However, the complexity required careful design and extensive testing.

\subsubsection{Integration Challenges}
Linking to external datasets like DBpedia proved valuable but required maintaining mapping tables and handling identifier inconsistencies.

\subsection{Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
\item Current RDFLib implementation doesn't support full federated queries
\item Vector database size limited by memory constraints
\item Real-time updates require graph consistency management
\item Complex reasoning queries can be computationally expensive
\end{itemize}
