## Extending the Knowledge Graph: Agentic GraphRAG & UI

### [Architecture]
- **Storage**: RDF Graph (RDFLib) + Vector Store (FAISS/ChromaDB) for unstructured data.
- **Reasoning Engine**: Groq LLM (LLama 3) + Owlready2 Reasoner (Hermit).
- **Frontend**: Streamlit (for rapid, premium-themed data exploration) or Vite (for a bespoke React experience).
- **Agent Logic**: A custom agent that decides whether to query the Knowledge Graph (SPARQL), use the Vector Store (Semantic Search), or perform Ontological Reasoning.

### [New Components]

#### [NEW] [graph_rag.py](file:///Users/ahsansaleem/Desktop/krrfinalproject/src/graph_rag.py)
Implement the "Agentic" loop:
1. Receive natural language query.
2. Delegate to Groq to generate SPARQL or identify entities.
3. Combine SPARQL results with unstructured data retrieved from uploaded documents.
4. Pass combined context to Groq for final answer generation.

#### [NEW] [app.py](file:///Users/ahsansaleem/Desktop/krrfinalproject/src/app.py)
A Streamlit-based UI featuring:
- **Chat Interface**: Interactive data exploration.
- **Graph Visualization**: Interactive nodes/edges display.
- **Upload Center**: Support for custom CSV/PDF/Markdown uploads to further enrich the KG.

### [Verification Plan Extension]
1. **End-to-End Chat Test**: Query the assistant about "Apollo 11 budget" (KG) and "Custom Uploaded Mission Bio" (Documents).
2. **Visual Check**: Verify that the graph updates dynamically when new data is uploaded.
