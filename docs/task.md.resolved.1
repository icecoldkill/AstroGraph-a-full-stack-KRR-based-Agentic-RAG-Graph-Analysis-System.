# Task: KRR Course Project - Global Space Exploration Knowledge Graph

## M1: Domain & Dataset Selection [x]
- [x] Research and select a non-RDF dataset from Kaggle or similar.
- [x] Verify the dataset is not already published as Linked Data.
- [x] Define motivation and context for the selected dataset.
- [x] Identify potential for interlinking (DBpedia, Wikidata).

## M2: Competency Questions & Conceptual Model [ ]
- [ ] Formulate at least 5-10 competency questions.
- [ ] Design the Conceptual Model (T-Box and A-Box examples).
- [ ] Identify existing vocabularies to reuse (e.g., Schema.org, FOAF, DBPedia-Ontology).

## M3: Ontology Design & Reasoning [ ]
- [ ] Design the Ontology in Protege/Python (20+ classes, 7+ object properties, 7+ datatype properties).
- [ ] Implement specific restrictions (Enumeration, Cardinality, Range, Union, Intersection, Complement).
- [ ] Define Functional and Inverse Functional properties.
- [ ] Perform consistency checking and reasoning.
- [ ] Annotate at least 10 individuals.

## M4: Data Conversion & Linking [ ]
- [ ] Develop Python scripts (RDFLib) to map CSV to RDF/OWL.
- [ ] Devise a meaningful URI mechanism.
- [ ] Implement interlinking with DBpedia/Wikidata.
- [ ] Publish as Linked Data (simulated or via GraphDB).

## M5: Validation & Visualization [ ]
- [ ] Execute SPARQL queries based on competency questions.
- [ ] Visualize the RDF data (VOWL or similar).
- [ ] Create walkthrough and final report.

## Bonus [ ]
- [ ] Implement SWRL rules.
- [ ] Develop a simple demo application.
