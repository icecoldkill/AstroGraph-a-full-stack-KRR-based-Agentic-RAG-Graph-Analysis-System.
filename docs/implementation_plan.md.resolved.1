# Implementation Plan - Global Space Exploration Knowledge Graph

## Goal
Build a comprehensive Knowledge Graph (KG) of global space exploration by converting non-RDF data (CSV) from Kaggle into RDF/OWL, interlinking it with the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud, and validating it via SPARQL and reasoning.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> I have selected the **"Global Space Exploration Dataset"** and **"All Space Missions from 1957"** as the primary data sources. They provide rich details on budgets, mission outcomes, and agencies that are often fragmented in existing LOD sets like DBpedia.

## Competency Questions
The following questions will be used to validate the Knowledge Graph:
1. **Budget Analysis**: Which agencies have launched missions with a budget exceeding $1 Billion?
2. **Success Rates**: What is the success rate of the 'Falcon 9' rocket vs other 'Heavy' class rockets?
3. **Exploration Targets**: Which countries have successfully launched missions to 'Mars' or 'Moon'?
4. **Entity Comparison**: Do 'PrivateCompanies' have a higher success rate than 'GovernmentAgencies' in the 2020-2025 period?
5. **Site Activity**: What are the most common 'SatelliteTypes' launched from specific 'LaunchSites' (e.g., Kennedy Space Center)?
6. **Operational Status**: List all 'Active' rockets and their corresponding 'Agencies'.
7. **Environmental Impact**: Which mission types have the highest 'EnvironmentalImpact' score? (Based on the selected dataset).

## Proposed Changes

### [Ontology Design]
Define a custom ontology in the `ontology/space_exploration.owl` file that meets all project requirements:
- **Classes (20+):** `Agency`, `SpaceMission`, `Rocket`, `Satellite`, `Payload`, `LaunchSite`, `Astronaut`, `Orbit`, `LaunchVehicle`, `GovernmentAgency`, `PrivateCompany`, `CrewedMission`, `UncrewedMission`, `MoonMission`, `MarsMission`, `SatelliteType`, `MissionSuccessStatus`, `Country`, `Continent`, `SpacePort`.
- **Properties (7+ Object, 7+ Datatype):**
  - Object: `launchedBy`, `launchedFrom`, `carriedPayload`, `hasOrbit`, `isSuccess`, `inverseOfLaunchedBy`.
  - Datatype: `hasBudget`, `launchDate`, `missionCost`, `rocketStatus`, `payloadWeight`, `agencyFoundingDate`.
- **Axioms:** Enumeration for `LaunchStatus`, Cardinality for `Rocket` stages, Range for `hasBudget`, Union for `LaunchEntity` (Agency | Company).

### [Data Conversion]
- **File:** `src/convert_to_rdf.py`
- Use `pandas` to read CSVs and `rdflib` to generate triples.
- Implement a URI strategy: `http://krr.org/space/agency/{name}`, `http://krr.org/space/mission/{id}`.

### [Linking & Publishing]
- **File:** `src/link_data.py`
- Use SPARQL and string matching to link agencies to `dbpedia:SpaceAgency` and countries to `wikidata:Country`.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
1. **Ontology Consistency**: Use `owlready2` or Protege's HermiT/Pellet reasoner to verify the ontology.
   - Command: `python src/check_consistency.py`
2. **SPARQL Validation**: Run queries in `queries/competency_questions.sparql` against the generated RDF.
   - Command: `python src/run_queries.py`

### Manual Verification
1. **Visualization**: Load the RDF into GraphDB or use VOWL to visualize the graph structure.
2. **Individual Check**: Manually inspect `ontology/individuals.owl` to ensure axioms are correctly applied to individuals.
